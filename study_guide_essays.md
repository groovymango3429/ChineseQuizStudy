## 1. Zhang Zhidong: The Three Necessities for China's Survival

### The Three Core Necessities and Their Interdependence

Zhang Zhidong, a prominent late Qing dynasty official and thinker, articulated three essential elements for China's survival during a time of unprecedented foreign pressure and internal crisis. His framework identified maintaining the state, preserving Confucian doctrine, and protecting the Chinese race as interconnected necessities that formed the foundation of his reform philosophy.

These three elements were not independent but formed a hierarchical and interdependent relationship. Zhang argued that to protect the Chinese race, one must first preserve Confucian doctrine, as it provided the moral and cultural foundation of Chinese identity. To preserve the doctrine, one must maintain the state, since without political power and institutional support, moral teachings could not be effectively transmitted or enforced. This chain of dependencies meant that the state's strength was ultimately tied to racial preservation, and racial preservation depended on knowledge and education.

Zhang emphasized that military power was essential for protecting Confucian doctrine. He famously stated that without imperial power and strong armies, the doctrine could not be properly followed or protected in practice. This recognition of the relationship between power and culture reflected his pragmatic understanding that ideals required institutional support to survive.

### Ti-Yong Framework: Chinese Learning as Essence, Western Learning as Utility

Zhang's most influential contribution to Chinese intellectual discourse was his ti-yong formulation: "Chinese learning for essence (ti), Western learning for utility (yong)." This framework became the intellectual foundation for conservative modernization efforts in late Qing China. Zhang distinguished between the unchangeable essence of Chinese civilization—its Confucian ethics, social hierarchies, and moral values—and the functional tools that could be borrowed from the West, primarily technology, military techniques, and industrial methods.

This formulation served multiple purposes. Philosophically, it provided a way to justify selective modernization without appearing to abandon Chinese cultural identity. Politically, it allowed reformers to advocate for significant changes while reassuring conservatives that core values would remain intact. Practically, it guided educational and institutional reforms by defining what should be preserved and what could be changed.

Zhang viewed Western learning as instrumental—mere tools to defend and strengthen Chinese civilization, not as possessing inherent philosophical or moral value. This perspective allowed China to adopt Western technology while maintaining that Chinese culture remained superior in essence. The ti-yong framework thus attempted to solve the dilemma of how to modernize while preserving cultural authenticity, though later thinkers would challenge whether such a separation was truly possible.

### Educational Reforms and Practical Modernization Efforts

Zhang Zhidong translated his philosophy into concrete educational and institutional reforms. He advocated for establishing modern schools that combined Western science and technology with Confucian ethical education. This curriculum integration reflected his belief that students needed both practical skills to strengthen China and moral grounding in traditional values to maintain cultural identity.

As a key figure in the Self-Strengthening Movement during the 1860s-1890s, Zhang supported establishing new schools, arsenals, factories, and modern industries using Western models. He promoted military modernization with Western training and equipment while maintaining that the ultimate purpose was defending Chinese civilization. His approach emphasized practical learning over pure theory, focusing on results rather than ideological purity.

Zhang's conservative modernization strategy sought to preserve traditional Chinese social order while adopting the material means to compete with Western powers. He viewed this as cultural defense—using Western tools against Western imperialism while protecting China's moral and cultural essence. Though his framework would later be criticized as inadequate for thorough modernization, it represented an important attempt to navigate the tension between tradition and modernity that defined China's modern transformation.

## 2. Kang Youwei: His Understanding of Confucius, Interpretation of Confucianism, and Stance Toward Family

### His Understanding of Confucius as a Progressive Reformer

Kang Youwei fundamentally challenged orthodox understandings of Confucius by portraying him as a progressive reformer and institutional innovator rather than a conservative transmitter of ancient traditions. Drawing on the New Text school of Confucian scholarship, Kang argued that Confucius was not merely preserving the past but actively creating new political and social systems disguised as ancient wisdom. This reinterpretation was revolutionary because it transformed Confucius from a defender of tradition into an agent of change.

Kang employed textual criticism to support his radical claims, arguing that many classical texts accepted as authentic were actually Han dynasty forgeries created to support authoritarian rule. By challenging the authenticity of key texts, he undermined orthodox interpretations and created space for his reformist reading. Kang presented Confucius as a sage-legislator who deliberately crafted reformed visions of antiquity to guide future social transformation, not to freeze society in past forms.

This understanding of Confucius served Kang's political purposes perfectly. If Confucius himself was a reformer, then radical institutional change could be presented as genuinely Confucian rather than Western or anti-traditional. Kang thus used Confucius's authority to legitimate constitutional monarchy, parliamentary institutions, and sweeping social reforms, arguing these represented the true spirit of Confucianism properly understood.

### Interpretation of Confucianism: The Three Ages and Universal Principles

Kang Youwei developed an evolutionary interpretation of Confucianism centered on his Three Ages Theory. He adapted Confucian concepts to describe historical progress through three stages: the Age of Disorder, the Age of Small Peace, and the Age of Great Unity (Datong). This framework transformed Confucianism from a static moral philosophy into a progressive vision of historical development moving toward ever greater harmony and equality.

Kang's vision of Datong represented a utopian future of universal harmony based on reinterpreted Confucian principles. He argued that Confucianism contained universal truths applicable to all humanity, not just China, and that properly understood, these principles supported constitutional monarchy, parliamentary government, and modern institutions. This interpretation emphasized egalitarian and reformist elements while downplaying hierarchical aspects of traditional Confucianism.

Kang combined Confucian thought with Western ideas of social evolution and progress, creating what scholars call "evolutionary Confucianism." He used this synthesis to justify the Hundred Days Reform of 1898, a failed but influential attempt to modernize Qing China through radical institutional changes presented as Confucian reforms. Though politically unsuccessful, his interpretation significantly influenced later debates about whether Chinese tradition was compatible with modernity or required fundamental transformation.

### Stance Toward Family: Revolutionary Social Proposals

Kang Youwei's stance toward the family represented his most radical and controversial proposals. In his utopian work "Datong Shu" (Book of the Great Unity), he advocated for the eventual abolition of the traditional family system. Kang viewed the family as a source of inequality, favoritism, and narrow self-interest that prevented the achievement of universal love and true social harmony. He argued that familial loyalties created particularistic obligations that conflicted with broader social welfare.

Kang proposed revolutionary alternatives to traditional family structures. He envisioned collective child-rearing through universal public education, where children would be raised by the state rather than by biological parents. He advocated for gender equality and women's economic independence through public employment, arguing the family system fundamentally oppressed women. His proposals for marriage reform included temporary contracts of one year and freedom in relationships rather than permanent bonds, giving both partners genuine choice and equality.

These proposals, extremely radical for early twentieth-century China, reflected Kang's commitment to philosophical consistency. If Confucianism truly aimed at universal love and harmony, then institutions promoting particularistic loyalties must eventually be transcended. However, Kang acknowledged these changes belonged to the distant future of the Great Unity, not immediate implementation. He accepted that family abolition required a long evolutionary process. Despite their utopian character, these ideas influenced later Chinese debates about gender relations, family reform, and the relationship between individual freedom and social organization.

## 3. Liang Qichao: Renewing People, Public Morality, Nationalism vs. Culturalism/Universalism

### Renewing the People: Creating Modern Citizens

Liang Qichao's concept of "renewing the people" (xinmin) represented a fundamental call for transforming Chinese character and consciousness to meet the challenges of modern nation-state competition. He argued that China's survival required creating "new citizens" with modern civic consciousness and public spirit, fundamentally different from traditional subjects who passively accepted authority. Liang believed that institutional reforms alone were insufficient—China needed a transformation in people's character, values, and sense of identity.

The xinmin concept emphasized active citizenship where individuals participated in political life and took responsibility for collective welfare. Liang promoted education that cultivated citizens rather than just moral individuals in the traditional Confucian sense. This meant developing national consciousness, awareness of public interests beyond family and kinship networks, and willingness to sacrifice for the nation. He argued that traditional Chinese habits and attitudes, while producing moral individuals, created people who lacked the group solidarity and public spirit necessary for modern nation-building.

Liang's vision sought to balance individual development with collective national strength. He incorporated Social Darwinist ideas about national competition, arguing that nations must strengthen themselves to survive in the modern world. Through his extensive journalism, Liang spread ideas about citizenship, constitutional government, and political participation, significantly influencing Chinese nationalism and debates about how to transform Chinese society while preserving cultural identity.

### Public Morality versus Private Morality

Liang Qichao made a crucial and influential distinction between private morality and public morality. He argued that China excelled in private morality—the ethics of personal conduct and family relationships emphasized in Confucian teaching. Chinese tradition produced individuals of refined moral character who fulfilled family duties and cultivated personal virtue. However, Liang identified a critical weakness: China lacked public morality, the civic virtue necessary for modern nation-states and collective action.

Traditional Confucian ethics prioritized family relationships and particularistic obligations, creating what Liang called moral particularism. People's moral concern extended primarily to family and close associates rather than to broader public welfare or national interests. This deficit in public morality meant Chinese people struggled to cooperate for collective purposes, to subordinate private interests to public good, or to feel responsibility for people beyond their immediate social network.

Liang argued that developing public spirit was essential for China to compete with Western nations, which had cultivated strong civic consciousness through their political institutions and educational systems. He called for expanding moral concern from the family circle to encompass the nation and public sphere. This required institutional ethics appropriate for modern states, not just personal virtue. While traditional Confucian ethics remained valuable, Liang argued they were insufficient for modern citizenship and needed to be supplemented by public morality emphasizing civic duties, public responsibility, and concern for collective welfare beyond kinship networks.

### Evolution from Culturalism to Nationalism

Liang Qichao's intellectual evolution from culturalism to nationalism reflected broader changes in Chinese thought during this period. Initially, Liang promoted Chinese culturalism, emphasizing China's civilizational superiority and the traditional concept of tianxia (all under heaven), which viewed China as a universal civilization rather than a particular nation. This culturalist perspective emphasized China's cultural achievements and moral superiority over Western material power, maintaining that cultural identity transcended racial or national boundaries.

However, foreign imperialism and internal crises forced Liang to gradually shift toward embracing modern nationalism. He came to recognize that in the modern international system of competing nation-states, China needed strong national identity and solidarity to survive. This transformation was pragmatic—Liang saw nationalism as necessary for mobilizing the population and resisting imperialism. He developed stronger racial consciousness and Han identity in response to both Manchu rule and foreign threats.

Liang incorporated Social Darwinist concepts of national competition and survival of the fittest into his thought, recognizing that nations, not civilizations, were the primary actors in modern international relations. Yet he struggled to balance universal Chinese cultural values with particular national interests. Through his journalism and political writings, Liang articulated a vision of Chinese nationalism that sought to preserve what was valuable in Chinese culture while embracing modern national identity. This synthesis of cultural pride and modern nationalism significantly influenced Chinese nationalist movements and debates about collective identity in the twentieth century.

## 4. Yan (Yen) Fu: Faith/Value vs. State/Country, Sage in the West and in China, His Understanding of Freedom

### Faith/Value versus State/Country: Personal Belief and Political Loyalty

Yan Fu played a crucial role in introducing Western thought to China through his influential translations of works by Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Herbert Spencer, and other Western thinkers. His translation work went beyond mere linguistic conversion—he analyzed and interpreted Western concepts for Chinese readers, often adapting them to Chinese philosophical frameworks. One area of particular interest was the relationship between personal faith or values and loyalty to the state.

Yan explored how Western societies managed the tension between individual conscience and state authority. In Western thought, individuals could hold personal values and religious beliefs distinct from state ideology, a concept rooted in ideas of religious freedom and individual rights. This contrasted sharply with traditional Chinese thought, which emphasized the unity of moral teaching and political authority. In Confucian tradition, the state's legitimacy rested on its moral foundation, and personal morality aligned with political loyalty.

Yan examined how Western nations achieved social cohesion despite religious plurality and freedom of belief, analyzing secular authority derived from social contract rather than moral teaching. He sought to understand whether China could adopt Western governance structures while maintaining social cohesion, and how the relationship between personal values and state loyalty might be reconceptualized. This exploration raised fundamental questions about moral autonomy, the source of political legitimacy, and whether China could separate personal belief from political authority without undermining social order and national unity.

### Sage in the West versus Sage in China: Two Models of Wisdom

Yan Fu conducted a sophisticated comparative analysis of how different civilizations conceived of the "sage" or ideal wise person. He examined how Western thinkers served as sages through scientific and philosophical inquiry, emphasizing empirical observation, experimentation, and systematic investigation of natural laws. Western sages advanced civilization through discoveries and inventions, contributing cumulative, verifiable knowledge that subsequent generations could build upon. Their wisdom was primarily intellectual and scientific.

In contrast, Chinese sages focused primarily on moral cultivation and ethical teaching. The sage ideal in Chinese tradition emphasized moral perfection, exemplary character, and the ability to guide others toward virtue. Chinese sages taught through moral example and philosophical reflection on human nature and proper conduct. Their wisdom was primarily ethical and practical, concerned with human relationships and social harmony rather than natural phenomena.

Yan recognized that these different sage ideals reflected deeper philosophical differences between civilizations. Western education prioritized analytical thinking, scientific method, and empirical knowledge, while Chinese education prioritized moral character and ethical wisdom. He suggested that both types of wisdom were valuable but served different functions—Western sages advanced material civilization and understanding of nature, while Chinese sages maintained moral civilization and social harmony. This analysis raised questions about whether China could develop scientific inquiry and sages who pursued empirical knowledge while maintaining its moral-ethical tradition, and whether these two forms of wisdom could be synthesized or were fundamentally incompatible approaches to human understanding.

### His Understanding of Freedom: Self-Discipline and Natural Law

Yan Fu's interpretation of Western liberty was distinctive and nuanced, avoiding both uncritical adoption and simple rejection. Rather than understanding freedom as unlimited license or anarchic individualism, he interpreted it as self-discipline and following natural laws. This reading drew on both Western sources, particularly Herbert Spencer's evolutionary philosophy, and Chinese philosophical traditions. Yan argued that true freedom operates within natural and social laws, not against them—genuine liberty means developing according to natural principles rather than arbitrary constraint or chaotic disorder.

Yan introduced the concept of qun (群), emphasizing group solidarity and collective strength while balancing individual freedom. He argued that Western nations succeeded by cultivating individual energy and initiative within strong collective frameworks that channeled individual efforts toward national strength. Freedom, properly understood, meant the ability to develop one's potential within social constraints necessary for collective survival. This was not unlimited individualism but disciplined freedom requiring self-control, education, and moral cultivation.

Drawing on Spencer's evolutionary theories applied to social development, Yan argued that freedom develops gradually as society evolves and people become more educated and capable of self-governance. Unlike radical reformers who sought immediate transformation, Yan favored gradual change based on education and cultural development. He emphasized that individual freedom must ultimately serve national strengthening and collective survival—in the context of international competition and Social Darwinism, China needed to harness individual energy for national power. Yan's interpretation attempted to make Western concepts of liberty compatible with Chinese emphasis on social harmony and collective welfare, arguing that properly understood, freedom and social order were complementary rather than contradictory. His translation and interpretation of "On Liberty" and other works profoundly influenced Chinese understanding of Western political thought.

## 5. The Relationship Between Substance (Body/Ti) and Function (Use/Yong) in Ancient Meaning, Zhang Zhidong, Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, and Yan Fu

### Ancient Meaning: Classical and Buddhist Origins

The ti-yong (substance-function) framework originated in classical Chinese philosophy and developed significantly through Buddhist influence. Originally a metaphysical concept, ti-yong distinguished between essence or underlying principle (ti) and its manifestation or practical application (yong). In classical usage, these were not truly separable but represented two aspects of a single reality, like the relationship between body and its functions or between wave and water.

Buddhist philosophy significantly shaped the development of ti-yong concepts, using them to distinguish between absolute truth and phenomenal reality. Neo-Confucian philosophers adapted the framework to discuss the relationship between principle (li) and its manifestation in particular things and events. In this traditional metaphysical context, ti represented the underlying principle, essence, or substance that gives rise to yong, the practical application, function, or manifestation.

The classical understanding emphasized organic unity—ti and yong were inseparable aspects of one reality. Pre-modern usage stressed their mutual dependence and the impossibility of truly separating substance from function. This holistic understanding would later contrast sharply with modern attempts to divide Chinese essence from Western function, raising questions about whether such separation violated the original philosophical meaning of the ti-yong framework and whether it was philosophically coherent to separate what was traditionally understood as organically unified.

### Zhang Zhidong's Conservative Framework

Zhang Zhidong's formulation—"Chinese learning for essence (ti), Western learning for utility (yong)"—became the most influential modern application of the ti-yong framework. Zhang used this concept to justify selective modernization while preserving Chinese cultural identity. He maintained that Confucian ethics, social hierarchies, and political order formed the unchangeable essence (ti) that must never be compromised, while Western science, technology, and industrial methods were merely functional tools (yong) that China could adopt.

This framework served multiple strategic purposes. Philosophically, it provided intellectual justification for adopting Western methods without appearing to abandon Chinese tradition. Politically, it reassured conservatives that core values would remain intact while allowing reformers to advocate for significant practical changes. Zhang created a hierarchy of values where Chinese moral and cultural essence was permanent and superior, while Western methods were temporary, pragmatic, and lacking inherent philosophical or moral value.

Zhang applied this framework practically to educational reform and modernization efforts. He advocated for schools combining Western science with Confucian ethics, arsenals using Western technology, and industries employing Western methods—all while maintaining that these were merely tools to strengthen and defend Chinese civilization. This conservative modernization strategy allowed for change in techniques while maintaining social and moral stability, attempting to preserve traditional social order while adopting material means to compete with Western powers. Though later criticized as inadequate, Zhang's framework represented an important attempt to navigate the tension between tradition and modernity.

### Kang Youwei's Radical Reinterpretation

Kang Youwei fundamentally challenged Zhang Zhidong's rigid separation between Chinese essence and Western utility. He argued that Confucianism itself could serve as ti for both Chinese and universal values, transcending the dichotomy between Chinese and Western. Kang claimed that Confucianism contained universal principles applicable to all humanity, and that properly understood, Confucian essence was compatible with Western institutions and could support modern reforms.

Kang's reinterpretation made ti itself dynamic and progressive rather than static and conservative. He argued that Confucianism's essence was reformist, not conservative—it supported constitutional monarchy, parliamentary government, and modern institutions. This reading allowed him to justify sweeping reforms as authentically Confucian rather than foreign impositions. Kang used the ti-yong framework not to preserve tradition unchanged but to legitimate radical transformation.

By presenting Confucianism as inherently progressive and universally applicable, Kang sought to transcend the limitations of Zhang's framework. He rejected the sharp distinction between Chinese and Western, suggesting instead that Confucian principles could serve as philosophical foundation for modern institutions regardless of their geographic origin. This interpretation had radical implications, as it suggested that genuine Confucianism required institutional and social reforms that conservatives opposed. Kang's evolutionary understanding of ti—that essence itself develops through historical stages—challenged the assumption that Chinese essence was fixed and unchangeable, opening possibilities for fundamental transformation while maintaining claims to cultural continuity.

### Liang Qichao's Critical Evolution

Liang Qichao initially accepted the ti-yong framework but gradually recognized its limitations through critical analysis. He came to understand that Western learning included not only practical techniques but also substantive political philosophy, social values, and institutional principles. Western political institutions, legal systems, and social structures represented their own ti, not merely yong. This recognition challenged the assumption that China could adopt Western techniques while maintaining entirely separate philosophical and cultural foundations.

Liang argued that effective reform required comprehensive transformation rather than superficial adoption of tools. He recognized that technology and institutions were inseparable from their philosophical and cultural foundations—Western science and industry arose from and depended on particular values, social structures, and ways of thinking. This systemic understanding suggested that China needed to adopt Western political and social institutions, not just technology, and that selective borrowing might be philosophically incoherent.

Liang's synthetic vision sought to move beyond rigid boundaries between Chinese and Western. Rather than defending Chinese essence against Western function, he advocated for flexible understanding of Chinese identity compatible with deeper reforms and genuine synthesis of Chinese and Western thought. His gradual shift from accepting Zhang's framework to recognizing its inadequacy reflected growing awareness that modernization required more fundamental changes than conservative reformers acknowledged. Liang struggled with how to transform China while preserving valuable cultural elements, ultimately questioning whether the ti-yong dichotomy helped or hindered clear thinking about China's challenges.

### Yan Fu's Philosophical Critique

Yan Fu provided the most thorough philosophical critique of attempts to separate substance and function. He questioned whether ti and yong could truly be separated in practice, arguing that such separation violated the classical meaning of organic unity. Unlike Zhang's claim that China could adopt Western techniques while maintaining separate cultural essence, Yan argued that Western strength came from integrated philosophical and institutional systems where values, institutions, and techniques formed coherent wholes.

Yan suggested that Western liberty and individualism were the true ti behind Western power—not merely functional tools but foundational principles that shaped Western civilization's entire structure. He demonstrated that technology and scientific method reflected and depended on underlying values and institutions, making it impossible to adopt techniques without their philosophical foundations. This analysis posed fundamental challenges to conservative reformers' attempts to preserve Chinese essence unchanged while borrowing Western methods.

Yan emphasized intellectual honesty in recognizing that Western success came from coherent philosophical systems, not isolated tools that could be extracted and transplanted. His educational proposals included teaching Western philosophy and values, not just practical subjects, because he understood that genuine understanding required grasping integrated systems of thought. Yan's critique implied that China needed deeper cultural and philosophical transformation than conservatives acknowledged. By exposing the intellectual inconsistency in trying to separate technique from philosophy, Yan challenged the entire ti-yong framework as applied to China's modernization, suggesting that truly effective reform required confronting difficult questions about cultural identity and transformation that the ti-yong dichotomy allowed reformers to avoid.
