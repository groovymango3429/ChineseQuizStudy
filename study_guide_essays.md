## 1. Zhang Zhidong: The Three Necessities for China's Survival

Zhang Zhidong, a prominent late Qing dynasty official and thinker, articulated three essential elements for China's survival during a time of unprecedented foreign pressure and internal crisis. His framework identified maintaining the state, preserving Confucian doctrine, and protecting the Chinese race as interconnected necessities. Zhang argued these elements formed a hierarchical relationship where each depended on the others: protecting the race required preserving Confucian teachings, which in turn required a strong state.

Central to Zhang's philosophy was the belief that knowledge and education were fundamental to racial preservation and national strength. He emphasized that military power was essential for protecting Confucian doctrine, famously stating that without imperial power, the doctrine could not be properly followed. Zhang's most influential contribution was his ti-yong formulation: "Chinese learning for essence, Western learning for utility." This framework allowed him to advocate for selective modernization—adopting Western technology and scientific methods while maintaining traditional Chinese values and Confucian ethics as the unchangeable core of Chinese civilization. His approach represented a conservative path to modernization, seeking to strengthen China against Western imperialism while preserving its cultural identity and traditional social order.

## 2. Kang Youwei: His Understanding of Confucius, Interpretation of Confucianism, and Stance Toward Family

Kang Youwei radically reinterpreted Confucianism by portraying Confucius as a progressive reformer rather than a conservative defender of tradition. He challenged orthodox interpretations of classical texts, arguing many were later forgeries, and developed his "Three Ages Theory" that depicted history as progressing through stages toward universal harmony. Kang's vision of "Datong" (Great Unity) represented a utopian future based on Confucian principles but incorporating dramatic social transformations.

Most controversially, Kang proposed revolutionary changes to family structures. In his work "Datong Shu," he suggested the eventual abolition of the traditional family system, advocating instead for universal public education where children would be raised collectively. He promoted gender equality and women's rights, proposing temporary marriage contracts and freedom in relationships—ideas considered extremely radical for his time. Kang's reinterpretation of Confucianism combined traditional Chinese thought with Western ideas of social evolution and progress. He led the failed Hundred Days Reform of 1898, attempting to transform Qing China through institutional reforms based on his vision of evolutionary Confucianism. Though his political efforts failed, his reinterpretation of Confucius as a reformer and his bold social proposals significantly influenced modern Chinese intellectual discourse and debates about tradition and modernity.

## 3. Liang Qichao: Renewing People, Public Morality, Nationalism vs. Culturalism/Universalism

Liang Qichao's concept of "renewing the people" emphasized creating modern citizens with public consciousness necessary for building a strong nation-state. He made a crucial distinction between private and public morality, arguing that while China excelled in private moral cultivation, it lacked the public morality essential for modern political life. Traditional Chinese ethics focused on family relationships and personal virtue, but Liang believed modern citizens needed civic duties, public responsibility, and active political participation.

Liang's thought also evolved regarding nationalism and culturalism. Initially, he promoted Chinese culturalism, emphasizing civilizational superiority over racial or national identity. However, facing foreign imperialism and internal crises, he gradually shifted toward embracing modern nationalism as necessary for China's survival. This transformation reflected his recognition that in the modern world of competing nation-states, China needed strong national identity and solidarity. He used journalism extensively to spread his ideas about political and social reform, advocating for constitutional government and citizen participation. Liang incorporated Social Darwinist concepts of national competition, arguing that nations must strengthen themselves to survive. His work on citizenship and public morality significantly influenced Chinese nationalism and debates about how to transform Chinese society while preserving cultural identity in the modern world.

## 4. Yan (Yen) Fu: Faith/Value vs. State/Country, Sage in the West and in China, His Understanding of Freedom

Yan Fu played a crucial role in introducing Western thought to China through his translations of influential works by Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, and Herbert Spencer. He explored the relationship between personal faith or values and loyalty to the state, analyzing fundamental differences between Western and Chinese philosophical approaches. Yan compared how Western thinkers served as "sages" through scientific and philosophical inquiry, emphasizing empirical knowledge and systematic investigation, while Chinese sages focused primarily on moral cultivation and ethical teaching.

Yan's interpretation of freedom was distinctive and nuanced. Rather than understanding Western liberty as unlimited license, he viewed it as self-discipline and following natural laws. He introduced the concept of "qun" (群), emphasizing group solidarity and collective strength while balancing individual freedom. Drawing on Spencer's evolutionary theories, Yan argued that Western nations succeeded by cultivating individual energy within strong collective frameworks. He believed freedom meant the ability to develop one's potential within social constraints, not anarchic individualism. Unlike more radical reformers, Yan favored gradual change based on education and cultural transformation. He emphasized adopting Western scientific methods and understanding that Western strength came from integrated philosophical systems, not just isolated techniques. His translations and interpretations profoundly influenced Chinese understanding of Western political and economic thought.

## 5. The Relationship Between Substance (Body/Ti) and Function (Use/Yong) in Ancient Meaning, Zhang Zhidong, Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, and Yan Fu

The ti-yong (substance-function) framework became central to debates about Chinese modernization. Originally a metaphysical concept distinguishing essence from manifestation, it was adapted to address the challenge of adopting Western ideas while preserving Chinese identity. Zhang Zhidong's formulation—"Chinese learning for essence, Western learning for utility"—represented conservative modernization, maintaining Confucian ethics as unchangeable essence while treating Western technology as mere tools.

Kang Youwei challenged this rigid separation, arguing that Confucianism itself could serve as ti for universal values compatible with Western institutions. He sought to transcend the dichotomy by demonstrating Confucianism's progressive potential. Liang Qichao initially accepted the ti-yong framework but gradually recognized its limitations, arguing that Western learning included both substance and function. He advocated for adopting Western political and social institutions, not just technology, pursuing synthesis rather than rigid boundaries.

Yan Fu most thoroughly critiqued the ti-yong separation, questioning whether substance and function could truly be divided. He argued Western strength came from integrated philosophical systems, not isolated techniques, suggesting that Western liberty and individualism were the true ti behind Western power. These different interpretations reflected fundamental debates about Chinese cultural identity, the nature of modernization, and whether China could successfully adopt Western methods while maintaining traditional values or needed more fundamental transformation of its philosophical foundations.
